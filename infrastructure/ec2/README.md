# Ec2 Processes
Below is the how-to documentation of common processes that are required for the Ec2 instances.
Examples show how to implement the changes on QA sytem.

## Restore Ec2 from a Snapshot
./infrastructure/config/qa.conf
- Set the "EC2RestoreAMI" parameter to the AMI ID to which you want to restore the Ec2. Push the changes, the Cloudformation will restore the Ec2 to this AMI.
- The restore will only be done when the parameter is changed, Cloudformation will not restore automatically on future changes that don't caue a replacement.


## Change Instance Type of the Ec2 Instance
./infrastructure/config/qa.conf
- Set the "EC2InstanceType" parameter to the Ec2 Instance Type which you require. Push the changes, the Cloudformation will change the Instance Type of the Ec2.
